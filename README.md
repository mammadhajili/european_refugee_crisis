# European refugee crisis: interplay of power between politics, media and citizens

# Abstract
In last decades because of the rising poverty and conflicts in developing regions such as Maghreb(Sub-Saharan Africa), Latin America and Middle East the immigration to Europe had been steadily increasing. In recent years, this tendency was accelerated by the starting of the revolutions and civil wars in Arab countries - so called Arab Spring and reached the crisis level (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis). 

In our report, we want to explore the emergence of this refugee crisis topic. In theory, politics, media and people's oponion influence each other. However, the time series data gives us a chance to study the causility of those three. For example, maybe the refugee crisis topic first arses with people's oppnion, then is followed by politics then media. Maybe it's opposite. 

To study this, we conduct a analysis on extracting the time evolution (from January 1st 2015 to December 31st 2017) of politic approach, news media coverage and people's oponion by searching the key words or sentiment analysis related to refugee crisis on Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT), Twitter database, wikipedia etc.

# Questions for TAa
To explore people's oponion, we want look at the poll data.But we are not sure where we could find the poll dataset. Do you have some suggestion about this dataset?

As our definition: poltics arrproach: search keywords on newspaper; media: tone using GDELT. people's oponion: sentiment analysis on twitter, poll dataset. Do you have more suggestion about the way that we used to extract politic, mediaand people's oponion?
